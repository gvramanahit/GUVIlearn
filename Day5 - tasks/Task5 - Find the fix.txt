1. Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read the property.
-------------------------------------------------

function test(t) {      //defining a function
  if (t === undefined) {       //if t=undefined, call tt
        console.log(t.tt)      //call tt member from t
  }
  return t;    
}
var a;    //a is a variable with undefined value
console.log(test(a)); //function call

Since the variable a is not initiated and we are trying to access a property of a we are getting
'Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read the property 'tt' of undefined'.

This can be fixed by initiating the variable a or having an error handling like below.

if (typeOf(a) != 'undefined') {
  ...
}


2. TypeError: undefined is not an object.
------------------------------------------
This is similar to the above error. But the only difference is that this error occurs in Safari.


3. TypeError: null is not an object.
------------------------------------
This is an error that occurs in Safari when you read a property or call a method on a null object.
In Chrome, we get 'VM167:2 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of null' for the same case.
This error occurs when the below code is executed.

var a = null;
console.log(a.length);

The below error handling can be done to handle this error.

if (a != 'null' ) {
  ...
}


4. (unknown): script error.
---------------------------
The Script error occurs when an uncaught JavaScript error crosses domain boundaries in violation of the cross-origin policy.

5. TypeError: undefined is not a function.
-------------------------------------------
This is an error that occurs in Chrome when you call an undefined function.

function clearBoard(){
  alert("Cleared");
}

document.addEventListener("click", function(){
  this.clearBoard(); 
});

If the above code is run, it results in the following error "Uncaught TypeError: this.clearBoard is not a function".

The below can solve this problem.

var self=this;  
document.addEventListener("click", function(){
  self.clearBoard();
});

or

document.addEventListener("click",this.clearBoard.bind(this));

6. TypeError: Object doesn't support property.
----------------------------------------------
This error is similar to the above error. The only difference is that this error message is thrown when the code
is executed in IE.
