Difference between window, document & screen.

Window:
Window object is right at the top of the javascript objects hierarchy. It's a 
global object and is the first object that gets loaded into the browser. 
This object can be accessed as window. 

Document:
The document object is the html or php or any document that will be loaded
into the browser. The document actually gets loaded inside the window object 
and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc.
This object can be accessed as window.document.{property} or document.property

Screen: 
Screen object contains the information about the visitor's screen.
It can either be accessed as window.screen or screen

Since window object is a global object, no need to explicitly mention the 
window object to refer it's properties. It will usually be figured out
during the run time.
